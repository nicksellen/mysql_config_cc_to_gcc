=== the problem

gem install mysql

this fails on Solaris if mysql was compiled with cc (as if you use the sun webstack version) and ruby was compiled with gcc. this is because it gets it's options from mysql_config which supplies loads of Sun Studio specific things.

=== the solution

this script strips out the Sun Studio options:

cd /tmp
wget http://github.com/nicksellen/mysql_config_cc_to_gcc/raw/master/mysql_config_cc_to_gcc
chmod +x /tmp/mysql_config_cc_to_gcc
gem install mysql -- --with-mysql-config=/tmp/mysql_config_cc_to_gcc
